#### What I expect from this hackathon
Wikidata is growing by the day, leading to more and more timeouts on relatively simple queries (e.g. Give me all Wikidata items with a DOI.) With the support of ShEx in Wikidata in its EntitySchema extension it is possible to draw the bounderies between a subset of Wikidata of interest. During the biohackathon I would like to work on enabling a workflow, to based on a Shape Expression, generate this subset. Two main use-cases that comes to mind are: 1. Creating a subset to enable more complex queries by loading that subset in a local RDFStore. 2. Create backup subsets for future/persistent reference. 

#### Skills I bring to the table
* Shape Expressions, Wikidata, Wikibase
* Wikidata Integrator
* Python
* SPARQL

#### Skills I bring to the table
* Shape Expressions, Wikidata, Wikibase
* SPARQL

## Use cases

Collect some examples of ShEx schemas as a running example

## Approach

* Use slurp from ShEx validators to populate another Wikibase
